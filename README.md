# Trenton-True-Crime
### Murder Mystery Game


This project was conceived to create digital value for the [Trentoniana](http://www.trentonlib.org/trentoniana/) collection at the Trenton Free Public Library. It is meant to be an interactive story-based experience that is accessible and interesting to people from a wide range of backgrounds. Based on a true story found in the archives of the Trentoniana collection, the hope is that this short game will garner interest in the history of Trenton and inspire patrons to visit the collection. In addition, this project was designed with future expansion in mind. The wireframe and the code itself can be recycled to an extent to produce new story-based games similar to this one.

The game is written in JavaScript and utilizes HTML5's Canvas feature, thus it can be easily embedded into any website and played on a wide range of devices. It is touchscreen-friendly as it was also designed to be accessible through a physical kiosk at the Trenton Free Public Library itself.
